	description  = One of the most crucial skills that the Janus program is meant to develop is the ability to rendevous and dock in space. This simple docking mechanism doesn't have the ability to transfer crew or resources, but it will allow you to connect two vessels in flight. This male active docking mechanism corresponds to the female M-C32F Docking Port. It include an indexing key, that slides into the V shape on the Belle Docking Adapter, to help line the two craft up properly.
