SUBJECT: Advanced Mk1 Capsule

The Transport, Rendezvous, And Interplanetary Logistics Spacecraft is a 2 Kerbal pod designed as a follow up 
to the widely successful Mk1 Pod from Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc. In the interest of 
rapid developement of an advanced capsule able to carry a larger crew for a longer duration, a consortium has 
been formed by Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc., O.M.B. Demolition Enterprises, and Jebediah 
Kerman's Junkyard and Spacecraft Parts Co.

The proposed collection of parts shall include:

G Launch Escape System\* - Escape tower rocket motor for pulling Big G type capsule asseblies to safety.

M-63E "Vinci" Command Pod - A 2 Kerbal command pod capable of longer duration missions.

M-KZR Heatshield - 1.5m heatshield for use with Vinci pod.

M-7RC Landing Parachute System - Inline parachute assembly able to be used with either the Vinci OR Mk1 pod.

M-C32 Nose Docking Mechanism - Nosecone docking port able to be used with either the Vinci OR Mk1 pod.

M-68V Reentry Reaction Thrusters - Inline RCS assembly capable of Yaw, Pitch, and Roll control.  Suitably 
sized to be used with both the Vinci and Mk1 pods.

M-3VS "Botticelli" Crew Module - Connecting Command pod, capable of independent operation or use with Vinci 
pod for larger crew capacity - possibly for transporting crew to/from proposed permanent space station.

M-O7N "Medici" Service Module - A tapered fuel tank assembly carrying Liquid Fuel, Oxidizer, Monopropellant, 
and forward translation RCS thrusters.

M-5HA Radial Control Thruster - 3 axis RCS assembly.  Intended for use with the Medici service module as the 
Medici has forward translation thrusters built in.

Also included are 3 structural adapters allowing mating of these parts to both 2 1/2 meter and 1 1/4 meter 
fuselages, as well as appropriate decouplers from O.M.B. that have been resized to match our 1 1/2 meter 
(150cm) and 1 7/8 meter (187.5cm) parts.

\* for traditional 2 kerbal launches using only the vinci pod - Vangard Technologies ejection seats are to be used.
